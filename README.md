This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Spent Time

For limited time, this is my best result, Focus on basic User Interface. I start create this project at 20:36 and end 23:53

## Completed

- Most of the basic layout;
- Glow effect;
- Responsive in some part;

## Skiped

- images assets
- some small contents like a language
- toggle sidebar

## With more Time

- All skipped part
- better responsive on mobile by putting sidebar menu to the bottom, look like a tab bar items in mobile app.
- user interactions
